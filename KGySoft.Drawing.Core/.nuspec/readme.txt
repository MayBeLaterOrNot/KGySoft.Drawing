Some Highlights of KGy SOFT Drawing Core Libraries:

- Creating managed bitmap data of any pixel format on every platform, including Linux and MacOS
- Creating bitmap data for any preallocated buffer using any pixel format. This allows accessing the pixels
  of bitmaps of any technology if the bitmap data is exposed as a pointer or array.
- Quantizing using predefined or optimized colors
- Dithering using ordered, error diffusion, random noise or interleaved gradient noise dithering techniques
- Creating GIF animations even in high color.

💡 Tip:
- For GDI+ specific solutions see the KGySoft.Drawing package. It makes possible to create managed, fast accessible
  bitmap data for the Bitmap class, supporting all pixel formats. It also contains many extensions for the Icon,
  Bitmap, Image, Metafile and Graphics types.
- For WPF specific solutions see the KGySoft.Drawing.Wpf package. It makes possible to create managed, fast
  accessible bitmap data for the WriteableBitmap class, supporting all pixel formats.
