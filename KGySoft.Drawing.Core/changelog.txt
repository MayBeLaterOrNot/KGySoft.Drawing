! Breaking change
* Compatible change
- Bugfix
+ New feature
===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~
! v7.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This is the first version of KGySoft.Drawing.Core but as it was extracted from the KGySoft.Drawing library the
changes are compared to KGySoft.Drawing v6.3.2. Breaking changes can be interpreted as an upgrade from that library.

! Assembly changes:
===================
! System.Drawing.Common package is no longer referenced (.NET Core/Standard 2.0 and above). To use APIs that depend
  on System.Drawing.Common (eg. Image, Bitmap, Icon, Metafile, etc.) reference the KGySoft.Drawing package.

+ KGySoft.Drawing namespace
===========================
+ The static AsyncContext class has been made public so consumer libraries can easily implement IAsyncResult or Task
  returning methods that can be configured by an AsyncConfig or TaskConfig parameter.

! KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging namespace
===================================
! IBitmapData interface:
  ! The type of the PixelFormat property from now on returns a PixelFormatInfo struct rather than an enum value of
    the System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat type. It now supports custom formats better and you still can convert it
    to a known format if needed.
! BitmapDataExtensions class:
  ! The ToBitmap/BeginToBitmap/EndToBitmap/ToBitmapAsync methods are now in the ReadableBitmapDataExtensions class
    of the KGySoft.Drawing package. When recompiling C# sources, this is not a breaking change if you use the
    KGySoft.Drawing package and use these methods as extensions (without the class name).
  + New Clone/CopyTo/DrawInto/Clear/TransformColors/Quantize/Dither overloads with IAsyncContext parameter.
+ New KnownPixelFormat enum. The names of the actual formats are compatible with System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat
  but some of them have different underlying values. Use the ToPixelFormat extension from KGySoft.Drawing to convert
  it to a System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.
+ New KnownPixelFormatExtensions class
! All System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat parameters have been replaced to KGySoft.Drawing.Imaging.KnownPixelFormat.
+ Palette class:
  + New public constructor to create a new Palette from an existing one with different back color and alpha
    threshold values.
  + The IsGrayscale and HasAlpha properties have been made public.
+ PixelFormatInfo struct:
  + New public constructor from KnownPixelFormat
  + New IsCustomFormat property
  + Implementing IEquatable<PixelFormatInfo>
  + Equality and inequality operators are overloaded
  + New ToKnownPixelFormat method
