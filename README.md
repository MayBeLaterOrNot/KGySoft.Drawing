### Download Binaries:

The binaries can be downloaded as a NuGet package directly from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KGySoft.Drawing)

However, the preferred way is to install the package in VisualStudio either by looking for the `KGySoft.Drawing` package in the Nuget Package Manager GUI, or by sending the following command at the Package Manager Console prompt:

    PM> Install-Package KGySoft.Drawing

### Download Demo App and Debugger Visualizers:

[KGySoft.Drawing.Tools](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.Drawing.Tools) is another GitHub repository, which contains a couple of applications built on KGy SOFT Drawing Libraries along with debugger visualizers for several `System.Drawing` types including `Bitmap`, `Metafile`, `Icon`, `Graphics` and more.
